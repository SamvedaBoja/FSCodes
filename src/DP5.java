/*
For a string sequence, a string word is k-repeating if word concatenated k times is a
substring of sequence. The word's maximum k-repeating value is the highest value k
 where word is k-repeating in sequence. If word is not a substring of sequence,
 word's maximum k-repeating value is 0.

Given strings sequence and word, return the maximum k-repeating value of word in sequence.


Sample Testcase:1
--------------------------------
input=ababc
ab
output=2
Explanation:
-------------------------------
