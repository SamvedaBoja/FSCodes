Construction Work
Luke likes to construct and play with arrays. His dad gave him an array M of length N and assigned to him the following tasks to be done in order:
	•	  Create continuous groups of size i with the elements of the array M.
	•	  Once the groups are created, find the minimum values from each group and select the maximum value among all these minimum values.
	•	  Place the highest value as ith element in the new array P.
	•	  Repeat the process until the group size becomes equal to N.
You must help Luke to find the array P and return it as the output.
Note: Assume 1 based indexing in array M and P.
Input Specification:
inputi: An integer value N, representing the length of the array M. input2: An integer array M, representing the array Luke's dad gave him.
Output Specification:
Return the array P as the output. 321

Explanation:
With the given array M = (1,2,3) we can create continuous groups of size 1, 2
and 3.
•⁠  ⁠There are three groups of size 1: (1142)3) and the minifgum elements in these groups are the elements themselves. We get three choices 1, 2, and 3, of which the maximum is 3; therefore, the first element of the array P Will be 3.
	•	  There are two groups of size 2: (1,2), {2,3} and the minimum elements in these groups are (1} and (2), of which the maximum is 2; therefore, the second element of the array P will be 2.
	•	  There is only one group of size 3: (1,2,3) and the minimum element of the group is 1. Now as there are no alternatives to choose from, the third element of the array P will be 1.
Therefore, (3,2,12is neturned as the output.
